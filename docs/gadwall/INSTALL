Installation instructions
=========================

To install a Gadwall-based application:

- First, install Perl module dependencies with "cpanm ."
  (Gadwall requires a recent version of Perl: 5.14.2+)

- Set up the database by running "app schema install" as root.
  (Gadwall requires a recent version of Postgres: 9.2.x+)

- Edit app.conf and set any relevant configuration variables,
  e.g. the port to listen on (default: http://127.0.0.1:3000).

- Create secrets.conf (outside version control) and define "secret"
  (the HMAC secret key used to sign cookies), db_pass (if needed),
  and any other deployment secrets.

- Configure a front-end web server to proxy HTTP and HTTPS connections
  to http://127.0.0.1:3000. See docs/gadwall/frontend-server for more.

- Start the application with "hypnotoad ./app".
