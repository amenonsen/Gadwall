Starting out with Gadwall
=========================

Here's a very brief outline of how to get started with a new web
application using Gadwall:

0. Pick a name for the application, say Foo

1. git init foo && cd foo

2. echo "This is the Foo application" > README &&
   git add README && git commit -m "Start with a README"

3. /path/to/Gadwall/utils/import-gadwall

4. utils/rename-app Foo

Now you have a git repository for your application with its own copy of
Gadwall (included via subtree merge). Gadwall changes can be integrated
later using "git pull gadwall master".

5. Add a ('foo', 1) line to schema/001-schema.sql.
   See schema/README for more details about the schema layout.
