Constructing HTML pages
=======================

Gadwall's default Mojolicious::Plugin::PageConstruction provides helpers
for the construction of HTML pages. Here's an overview of the available
facilities (which serve to supplement Mojo's normal template mechanisms,
as explained in Mojolicious::Guides::Rendering).

» Page structure

An HTML page probably has some CSS near the top and some Javascript near
the end. In special cases, it might have Javascript in other places too.
If you want, you can move things around. Gadwall doesn't really care. 

» Widgets

» Inline CSS and Javascript

You can sprinkle inline CSS throughout your templates using the built-in
"stylesheet" helper, but you can also arrange to have it coalesced into
a single block in the document's head.

Put this in the templates:

    % css begin
        p { color: red; }
    % end

And this in the layout:

    %= css

This will assemble the provided snippets into a single <style> tag.

Same idea with the "js" helper and inline javascript.

» External dependencies

In order to include external stylesheets or scripts, a template may
contain something like the following:

    % requires '/js/jquery-ui.js', '/css/jquery-ui.css';

The appropriate <link> and <script> tags will be added before the inline
content in the "%= css" and "%= js" output above.
