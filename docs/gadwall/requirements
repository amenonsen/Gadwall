Gadwall expects to run on a Unix system with:

- Perl 5.12.3+
- PostgreSQL 9.x
- Perl modules: Mojolicious, DBD::Pg, and other modules listed in
  Makefile.PL (use "cpanm ." to install dependencies).

Mojolicious and associated modules are under active development, and new
versions may not be backwards-compatible. If required, specific versions
of these or any other modules can be distributed with the application by
placing them in the top-level "deps" directory.

Mojolicious applications can be run in various environments (standalone,
CGI, FastCGI, etc.), but the recommended configuration for Gadwall apps
(and the only one that is regularly tested) is to run behind a frontend
server with proxied HTTP connections. See docs/gadwall/frontend-server
for more details.
