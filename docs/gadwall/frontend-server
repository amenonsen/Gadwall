This is a brief explanation of how to deploy Gadwall applications behind
a frontend web server (nginx or Apache).

» Why?

Hypnotoad can be run in production, but there are at least two good
reasons to run it behind a frontend server:

    1. IO::Socket::SSL is flaky enough that I don't like to make it
       handle HTTPS.
    2. A frontend server can handle caching transparently for us.

I prefer nginx, but Apache is known to work, and it should be possible
to use any server with mod_proxy-like functionality.

» Why isn't it simple?

The frontend server and the application must cooperate to handle both
HTTP and HTTPS access transparently and securely. The basic principle
is that all authenticated access from the login page onwards must be
served only via HTTPS. (Alternatively, serve everything over HTTPS.)

To achieve this, we set up two VirtualHosts (servers in nginx), one for
HTTP and one for HTTPS, both proxying connections to the application via
HTTP (only). The HTTPS server must set the X-Forwarded-HTTPS header to 1
to tell the application that the connection is secure.

http {
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name gadwall.example.org;

        # rewrite ^/(.*)$ https://gadwall.example.org/$1 permanent;
        # OR:

        location {
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-HTTPS 0;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
            proxy_redirect off;
        }
    }

    server {
        listen 443;
        server_name gadwall.example.org;

        ssl on;
        ssl_certificate …;
        ssl_certificate_key …;
        # …other ssl parameters…

        location {
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-HTTPS 1;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
            proxy_redirect off;
        }
    }
}

» Apache example

Listen a.b.c.d:443
<VirtualHost a.b.c.d:443>
    ServerName gadwall.example.org
    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile ...
    SSLCertificateKeyFile ...
    ProxyRequests off
    ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:3000/
    ProxyPassReverse / https://127.0.0.1:3000/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:3000/
    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-HTTPS "1"
</VirtualHost>

Listen a.b.c.d:80
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName gadwall.example.org
    # Redirect permanent / https://gadwall.example.org
    # OR:
    ProxyRequests off
    ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:3000/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:3000/
    ProxyPassReverse / https://127.0.0.1:3000/
    RequestHeader unset X-Forwarded-HTTPS
</VirtualHost>

Make sure your frontend server will not pass through X-Forwarded-*
headers from the client.
