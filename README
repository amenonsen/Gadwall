Gadwall
=======

Gadwall is a foundation for building web applications based on the
Mojolicious web framework. It is named after a handsome duck (Anas
strepera) whose name does not resemble anything else on Github.

This code is under development, and there are no guarantees of backwards
compatibility. The author uses it in production, but would be surprised
if anyone else did so.
