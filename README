Gadwall
-------

Gadwall is a foundation upon which I can build web applications. Based
on the Mojolicious web framework, it is the result of some months spent
exploring the available options and finding a combination that suits me.

This program is named after the Gadwall (Anas strepera), a handsome duck
whose name does not resemble anything else on Github.
