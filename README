Gadwall
-------

Gadwall is a foundation upon which I can build web applications. Based
on the Mojolicious web framework, it is the result of some months spent
exploring the available options and finding a combination that suits me.

This program is named after the Gadwall (Anas strepera), a handsome duck
whose name does not resemble anything else on Github.


» Requirements

This program expects to run on a Unix system with:

- Perl 5.10.1+
- PostgreSQL 8.4+
- Perl modules: Mojolicious, DBI, DBD::Pg, Crypt::Eksblowfish::Bcrypt,
  Data::Entropy, Crypt::Rijndael, MIME::Lite

(Mojolicious and associated modules are under active development, and
may be version-sensitive. If necessary, specific versions of these or
any other modules may be distributed with the application by placing
them in the top-level deps directory.)

Gadwall is itself under development, and there are presently no
guarantees of backwards compatibility.


» Installation

To install a Gadwall-based application:

- First, set up the database. See utils/setup-schema

_ Edit app.conf to set db_name/db_user/db_pass if necessary, and also
  to set the "secret" used to sign session cookies.

- Configure a front-end web server to proxy HTTP and HTTPS connections
  to http://127.0.0.1:3000. See docs/gadwall/apache for an example.

- Use Hypnotoad ("hypnotoad ./app") or any suitable Plack web server
  ("plackup -s Starman ./app") to run the application in production.
