Gadwall
=======

Gadwall is a foundation for building web applications based on the
Mojolicious web framework. It is under development, and there are
no guarantees of backwards compatibility.

This program is named after the Gadwall (Anas strepera), a handsome
duck whose name does not resemble anything else on Github.
