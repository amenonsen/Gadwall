The application's SQL schema lives in this directory, split up into as
many files as needed for a logical arrangement.

- 000-extensions.sql should contain "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS"
  commands for any required extensions; Gadwall itself uses only citext.

- 001-schema.sql creates a schema (name,version) table, which is used to
  keep track of schema deployments and upgrades. Gadwall itself uses the
  name "gadwall"; applications are free to use other name(s) to identify
  components of their schema.

- Gadwall's own schema lives in 0XY-gadwall-*.sql; applications should
  generally never change these files directly.

- The application's schema should be in NXY-*.sql where N > 0.

- upgrades/$name/N-to-M.sql are scripts that upgrade a component named
  $name from version N to version M.

"app schema install" creates the database and users defined in defs and
loads NNN-*.sql in lexicographical order using psql.

"app schema upgrade" loads any outstanding upgrades, each in its own
transaction.
