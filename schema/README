The application's SQL schema lives in this directory, split up into as
many files as needed for a logical arrangement.

- "defs" defines DB, USER, and ADMIN

- The application's schema should be in NNN-*.sql

- Gadwall's own schema lives in NNN-gadwall-*.sql

- 000-schema.sql creates a schema (name,version) table, which is used to
  keep track of schema deployments and upgrades. Gadwall itself uses the
  name "gadwall"; applications are free to use other name(s) to identify
  components of their schema.

- upgrades/$name/N-to-M.sql are scripts that upgrade a component named
  $name from version N to version M.

utils/setup-schema creates the database and users defined in defs and
loads NNN-*.sql in lexicographical order using psql.

utils/upgrade-schema loads any outstanding upgrades, each in its own
transaction.
